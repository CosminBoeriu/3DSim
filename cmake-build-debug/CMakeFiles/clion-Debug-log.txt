CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /home/cosmin/Informatica/Projects/3dSim/cmake-build-debug/_deps/sfml-subbuild/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory c:/Informatica/C++Projects/3dSim1/cmake-build-debug/_deps/sfml-subbuild where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
